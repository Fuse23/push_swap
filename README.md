In this project, you need to implement a quick stack sort using only these actions:
- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
